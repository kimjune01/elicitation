# Pizza Order Elicitation Agent

A LangGraph application that facilitates pizza order elicitation through natural language conversations using Google's Gemini AI.

## Description

This conversational agent actively elicits pizza orders from customers by:
- Extracting structured pizza information (crust, toppings, size) from natural language
- Practicing active listening by acknowledging what customers have specified
- Identifying and rejecting non-pizza requests
- Clarifying ambiguous or incomplete orders through targeted questions
- Guiding customers to complete their pizza orders with all necessary details

## Setup

1. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Google API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API key: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
uv run langgraph dev
```

The server will start at:
- API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
